            <p>Yeah! uh! Sidhu Moose 'ala!

                Mere hath'an ch badbu ae marhe karma di
                Tere pinde cho khushbo aundi ae heer'an di
                Meri rooh nu japha paya esa haan diye
                Tu meri rooh nu japha paya esa haan diye
                Saun teri meri mukk gyi bhukh sareer'an di
                Mere hath'an ch badbu ae marhe karma di
                Tere pinde cho khushbo aundi ae heer'an di
                Haaye

                Jadd takk k mainu akh'an kare blink kude
                Sapp khane baaj de bas paigi tu kabootariye

                Mere hath'an cho badbu ae marhe karma di
                Tere pinde cho khushbo aundi ae heer'an di haaye
                Tu meri rooh nu japha paya esa haan diye
                Saun teri meri mukk gyi bhukh sareer'an di

                <h2>About the Song</h2>
                <p>"Aroma" is a riveting Punjabi number which balances profound emotion with vivid and blistering images.
                    Here, the artist talks about trials, karma, and a close relationship between his soul and the world. 
                    The chorus presents an antithesis to the artist's dark past and the sweet fragrance, indicating purity and positivity of his soul. 
                    The verses take us further into Sidhu's journey, beginning with a hint of that past filled with struggles and destiny but then unfurling layers with metaphors like 
                    the perfume of "heer'an"(diamonds) and the stench of bad "karma." Sidhu's style of storytelling makes his music come alive with a motif recognizable to his fans, expressing his struggles, growth, and finally peace with his path.</p>
